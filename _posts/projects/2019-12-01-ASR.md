<!-- I worked on this project during the autumn of 2019 (my third year) under the guidance of Prof. Preeti Jyoti. It was course project for CS753:Automatic Speech Recognition.

The input is a .wav file and the output is a single number(0-4) representative of the accent it represents. Extracted and refined the Long and Short Term features from the audio data using PCA and HLDA.
Improved the Accent classification by combining phonetic vowels with acoustic features and trained the model using a combination of Deep Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks

You can find the final report and presentation attached -->
