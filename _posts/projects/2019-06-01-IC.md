description: Contributed to control and hardware design of autonomous quadcopters in a GPS-denied environment. Implemented communication between on-board processor Intel i5 NUC, offboard computer and Pixhawk for transfer of localization and IMU data using MAVLink communication protocol on ROS. Utilized LiDAR sensors and Stereo Vision camera to maintain the current position of the quadcopter. Investigated optimum PID parameters which enhanced flight stability and performance
