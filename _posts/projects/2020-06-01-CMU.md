I worked on this project during the summer of 2020 (my third year) under the guidance of Prof. David Touretzky [LOR](assets/files/CMU-letter.pdf) at Carnegie Mellon University. The internship had to be done remotely because of Covid-19.<br>
<br>
This project will develop a Transfer Learning Tool for intelligent robot programming. Robots need to do more than classify images; they need to perceive objects situated in their environment. This requires both recognizing the object and estimating its pose (location and orientation) so that the robot can approach or avoid it.<br>
<br>
The project will use the Cozmo robot along with the comzo-tools programming framework created by the [PI](https://github.com/touretzkyds/comzo-tools). Cozmo's low resolution camera provides 320×240 gray scale or 160×240 color images. We also expect to support additional robots as part of the effort to port cozmo- tools to new platforms.
