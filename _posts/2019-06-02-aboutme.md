Hi. Iâ€™m Rishabh Ramteke, and I currently work at Honda R&D Japan as a Computer Vision Research Engineer I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Neuroscience. I was always interested in the working of human minds and how that technology can be incorporated to teach computers to be like us.
 
I am an avid reader and mostly a fan of fiction as it takes you on a fantastical journey, making you escape this reality. I love playing Lawn tennis and ice skating. Travelling and exploring the marvels of nature & various human cultures is another passion of mine. Pictures are the best souvenirs so it ultimately became an avocation.

Trying my best to achieve a Fullmetal Heart!
