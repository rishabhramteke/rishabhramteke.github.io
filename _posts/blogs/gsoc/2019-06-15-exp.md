## So finally was it worth....?

### Short Answer

Absolutely..... \\
GSoC was by far, one of the best learning experiences.

### Long Answer

I learned a lot of new things and some advanced concepts as well. This project helped to change my perspective today programming and made me realize about the crucial aspects from a practical standpoint. I would surely recommend anyone who would like to have some exposure in how the large codebases are managed, and you should try this program.
