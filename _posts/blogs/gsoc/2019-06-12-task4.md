## About the Task

The idea was to paginated output for the `FormSet` Similar to the `as_p` and `as_table`. This may have proven useful for someone using formsets to display a lot of forms at once and need some of the management from the backend side.

## What I did ??

I directly started writing the code for this task, as I have already discovered about the [`Paginator`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/pagination/) class in Django core. And that turned out to be a huge mistake. I didn't take reviews from any fellow contributor, on whether this feature was required or not, and if yes how to implement. I continued working on this for more than two and a half weeks, and finally, when I push the code along with the tests, someone raised the concern that new features will only be accepted if there was a corresponding approved ticket. So I launched a new ticket for the same. But after some discussion the tickets page it was decided that this feature is not needed, and I discontinued the task :(.
