## About the Task

What is task represent is that, not always you should blindly follow what a ticket request, you should always have a critical mindset.\\
The [ticket](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25139) requested to have a functionality where the user should be able to swap unique values (pk) in an HTML form backed by a ModelFormSet. Essentially this means that whenever there is a POST request coming in and `has_changed()` returned true we will need to check if there were any similar models to last time with only pk's swapped.

## What I did ??

This idea didn't resonate with me quite well at first. I thought of different ways of approaching this problem, but at the end, we will need to do `n(n -1)/2` comparision every time we call `save` and if there were some changes in the formset. I raised [this concerned](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25139#comment:4) on the forum. And it turns out it was a very valid argument. And the ticket was marked as `Someday/Maybe`. Lesson learned: Never blindly follow whatever you see no matter how good it may seem.

## Technical description of the task

The reporter of this ticket provided this test which will help us to understand the problem:
```python
def test_swap_unique_values(self):
    p0 = Product.objects.create(slug='car-red')
    p1 = Product.objects.create(slug='car-blue')
    FormSet = modelformset_factory(Product, fields="__all__")
    data = {
        'form-TOTAL_FORMS': '2',
        'form-INITIAL_FORMS': '2',
        # Swap slug values.
        'form-0-id': p0.pk,
        'form-0-slug': 'car-blue',
        'form-1-id': p1.pk,
        'form-1-slug': 'car-red',
    }
    formset = FormSet(data)
    self.assertTrue(formset.is_valid())
    formset.save()

    p0 = Product.objects.get(pk=p0.pk)
    self.assertEquals(p0.slug, 'car-blue')
    p1 = Product.objects.get(pk=p1.pk)
    self.assertEquals(p1.slug, 'car-red')
```

Here the function will throw an error at the `is_valid()` method saying that  "Product with this Slug already exists." The request was to allow such kind of POST request where pk of few elements are swapped.
