Hi

 ([yes, I have a new watch](https://www.skagen.com/en-us/aaren-kulor-neon-green-silicone-41mm-watch-skw6556) - it's very on brand for my blog).

We talk about machine learning algorithms as being evolutionary - i.e being derived from nature. But if there's one thing that nature's good at it's predators and prey. 

Of course, I'm certain at least some of these watches I'm being advertised barely exist - as per the magnificent investigation by Jenny Odell in her research report [There's no such thing as a free watch](http://www.jennyodell.com/free-watch.html).

The opposite of blood in the feed is... algorithmic whiplash? A sense of dislocation that comes from the algorithms trying to guess whether you're interested in credit card learning or a UFC fight. This sense of unreal disbelief - how can you get things so wrong?

Update #1: "Chum links" - Chum is shark bait thrown into the water. A chum link is a link that triggers a high intent signal of a specific kind to the algorithms triggering blood in the feed. Example - click this link and watch the enamel pin ads roll into your feed: <https://studiocult.co/> - *disclaimer I found that link via an ad so have no idea if the pins are real*
